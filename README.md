## Film Prioritization
The purpose of this case is to get experience in using a project 
priority system that ranks proposed projects by their contribution to the 
organization's objectives and strategic plan.
Among a number of items in evaluation form, this repository focuses on the 
inference of expected profit on 7 different project proposals.

## Test Result
[1. Inference by Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Curt-Park/GSOE9820_Project1_Profit_Inference/blob/master/maximum_likelihood_estimation_for_project_evaluation.ipynb)

[2. Inference by Mean and Std from Given Information](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Curt-Park/GSOE9820_Project1_Profit_Inference/blob/master/simple_approach_using_mean_and_std.ipynb)
